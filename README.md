## Installation
1. Install the package:
~~~~bash
python -m pip install justai
~~~~
2. Create an OpenAI acccount [here](https://platform.openai.com/)
3. Create OpenAI api keys [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
4. Create a .env file with the following content:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=your-openai-organization-id
```
## Usage

```Python
from justai import Agent

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent = Agent('gpt-3.5-turbo')
    agent.system = lambda: "You are a movie critic. I feed you with movie titles and you give me a review in 50 words."

    message = agent.chat("Forrest Gump")
    print(message)
```
output
```
Forrest Gump is an American classic that tells the story of
a man with a kind heart and simple mind who experiences major
events in history. Tom Hanks gives an unforgettable performance, 
making us both laugh and cry. A heartwarming and nostalgic 
movie that still resonates with audiences today.
```

## Using the examples
Install dependencies:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Basic
```bash
python examples/basic.py
```
Starts an interactive session. In the session you dan chat with GPT-4 or another model.

### Returning json
```bash
python examples/return_types.py
```
You can specify a specific return type (like a list of dicts) for the completion. 
This is useful when you want to extract structured data from the completion.

To define a return type, just pass return_json=True to agent.chat().

See the example code for more details.

### Interactive
```bash
python examples/interactive.py
```
Starts an interactive session. In the session you dan chat with GPT-4 or another model.

#### Special commands
In the interactive mode you can use these special commands which each start with a colon:
